# Pierre de Malliard

## Data Generalist / Full-Stack Data Scientist

Welcome to my GitHub Page! With over 8 years of experience in the AI/ML field, I am deeply passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, particularly in the Healthcare & Life Sciences domain. Recently, I have been contributing my expertise as a Full-Stack Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services, where I have had the opportunity to support healthcare clients and drive impactful solutions.

Throughout my career, I have embraced the role of a "Data Generalist," immersing myself in various aspects of the data ecosystem. From data engineering and architecture to data science and MLOps, I have gained valuable experience across multiple domains. My expertise extends to diverse areas such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Forecasting, Large Language Models, as well as more traditional machine learning approaches involving tabular data.

My main programming language is Python, but I also have experience in C++, JavaScript and R.
