## Data Generalist / Full-Stack Data Scientist

Hi, I am a seasoned AI/ML professional focused on AI/ML in the Healthcare & Life Sciences industry :microscope: ü©∫ üè•. 

My career has spanned various roles, including R&D at Masimo, a medical devices company, and my current position as Senior AI Solutions Architect at AWS in the Global Healthcare Lifesciences (HCLS) team.
Previously, I served as AI/ML Tech Lead at AWS Consulting Partner TensorIoT, where I led and scoped complex AI Machine Learning projects, with a focus on GenAI. I also worked as a Full-Stack Data Scientist in AWS Professional Services, delivering ML solutions and AI platforms for healthcare clients, including pharmaceutical industry leaders and healthcare providers.

My expertise extends to diverse areas such as Generative AI, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, as well as more traditional machine learning approaches involving tabular data

My main programming language is Python, but I also have experience in C++, JavaScript and R. 

I speak german, french, english and some spanish.

I am currently based in New York City :us:
