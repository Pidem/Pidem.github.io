# Pierre de Malliard

## Data Generalist / Full-Stack Data Scientist

Welcome to my GitHub Page! I have over 8 years experience working in the AI/ML space with a passion for solving problems in the Healthcare & Life Sciences space. Most recently, I have been working as a Full-Stack Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services supporting Healthcare clients. 

I consider myself a "Data Generalist", having worked in the Data Engineering, Data Science and MLOps side of things: I have experience in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Forecasting, Large Language Models and I have worked with both structured and unstructured data.
